# What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring <VueCustomTooltip label="A way to store information so a device can retrieve the data based on its content, not its location." underlined>content-addressed data</VueCustomTooltip> in a decentralized file system. 

IPFS can be thought of as both the implementations of the IPFS protocols (like <VueCustomTooltip label="The earliest and most widely used implementation of IPFS, written in Go." underlined>Kubo</VueCustomTooltip>) and the decentralized network comprised of the individual <VueCustomTooltip label="The IPFS program that you run on your local computer to store files and then connect to the IPFS network." underlined>nodes</VueCustomTooltip> that are running protocol implementations.

## Problems that IPFS addresses

IPFS seeks to address several problems with the current web, including:

- [Centralization](#centralization)
- [Performance](#performance)
- [Scalability](#scalablity)
- [Link rot](#link-rot)
- [Security](#security)

### Centralization

IPFS is an open-source, decentralized system that eliminates the need for a central authority, making it more resilient and censorship-resistant than traditional centralized systems.

### Performance

IPFS provides faster access to data by storing it at multiple locations, and allowing users to access it from the nearest location by using content addressing instead of location-based addressing.

### Scalability

IPFS has no single point of failure, and users do not need to trust each other.

### Link rot

IPFS eliminates the problem of broken links by allowing data to be addressed by its content, rather than by its location.

### Security

IPFS uses <VueCustomTooltip label="A function that takes some arbitrary input (content) and returns a fixed-length value. The exact same input data will always generate the same hash as output. There are numerous hash algorithms." underlined multiline is-medium>cryptographic hashes</VueCustomTooltip> to ensure the authenticity and integrity of files, making it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with or delete files.

## How IPFS works

Data in IPFS is addressed by its contents (content addressing), rather than a location such as a server address (location addressing). Various subsystems in IPFS are responsible for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data.

### How IPFS represents data

IPFS represents data as content-addressed objects using the following subsystems to represent data:

- InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)
- Content IDentifier (CID)


#### Content IDentifier (CID)

In IPFS, each object is assigned a unique identifier called a <VueCustomTooltip label="An address used to point to material in IPFS, based on the content itself, as opposed to the location." underlined multiline is-medium>Content IDentifier (CID)</VueCustomTooltip>. In general, the CID is generated by:

1. Computing a cryptographic hash of the object's data.
1. Combining that hash with other information about the hashed data using the following <VueCustomTooltip label="A collection of interoperable, extensible protocols for making data self-describable." underlined multiline is-medium>multiformats</VueCustomTooltip>. 
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established hash function." underlined multiline is-medium>Multihash</VueCustomTooltip> for information on the algorithm used to hash the data.
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating the format of the target data." underlined multiline is-medium>Multicodec</VueCustomTooltip> for information on how to interpret the hashed data after it has been fetched.
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating the encoding of base-encoded (e.g., base32, base36, base64, base58, etc.) binary data appearing in text." underlined multiline is-medium>Multibase</VueCustomTooltip> for information on how the hashed data is encoded.

CIDs are unique to the data from which they were computed, which provides IPFS with the following benefits:
- Data can fetched based on it's content, rather than it's location. 
- The CID of the data received can be computed and compared to the CID requested, to verify that the data is what was requested.

The CID protocol has two versions, v0 and v1. Currently, v1 is the preferred version. Each version computes the CID in a slightly different way, Learn more in [the CID deep dive](../concepts/content-addressing.md#cid-versions).

#### InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)

IPFS uses <VueCustomTooltip label="A set of specifications in support of decentralized, content-addressable data structures for the web." underlined multiline is-medium>InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)</VueCustomTooltip> to work with CIDs and content-addressed data. IPFS uses IPLD to structure, serialize, traverse and link content-addressed data. The IPLD linking mechanism allows IPFS to represent complex relationships between data objects, such as file directories and other hierarchical structures, using a <VueCustomTooltip label="Data structured as a graph whose nodes are directionally related to each other and donâ€™t form a directional closed loop." underlined multiline is-medium>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</VueCustomTooltip> called an <VueCustomTooltip label="A special type of DAG where each node has a unique identifier that is a hash of the node's contents." underlined multiline is-medium>Merkle DAG</VueCustomTooltip>. IPLD provides IPFS with the following benefits:

- Interoperable protocols
- Easy upgradeability
- Backwards compatibility
- A single namespace for all hash-based protocols
