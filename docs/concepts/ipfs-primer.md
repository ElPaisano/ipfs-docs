# What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data in a decentralized file system. 

IPFS can be thought of as both the implementations of the IPFS protocols (like Kubo, a Go implementation) and the decentralized network comprised of the individual nodes that are running protocol implementations.

## Problems that IPFS addresses

IPFS seeks to address several problems with the current web, including:

- [Centralization](#centralization)
- [Performance](#performance)
- [Scalability](#scalablity)
- [Link rot](#link-rot)
- [Security](#security)

### Centralization

IPFS is an open-source, decentralized system that eliminates the need for a central authority, making it more resilient and censorship-resistant than traditional centralized systems.

### Performance

IPFS provides faster access to data by storing it at multiple locations, and allowing users to access it from the nearest location by using content addressing instead of location-based addressing.

### Scalability

IPFS has no single point of failure, and users do not need to trust each other.

### Link rot

IPFS eliminates the problem of broken links by allowing data to be addressed by its content, rather than by its location.

### Security

IPFS uses cryptographic hashes to ensure the authenticity and integrity of files, making it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with or delete files.

## How IPFS works

Data in IPFS is addressed by its contents (content addressing), rather than a location such as a server address (location addressing). Various subsystems in IPFS are responsible for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data.

### How IPFS represents data

IPFS represents data as content-addressed objects. 

IPFS uses the following subsystems to represent data:

- InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)
- Content IDentifier (CID)


#### Content IDentifier (CID)

In IPFS, each object is assigned a self-describing unique identifier called a Content IDentifier (CID) based on its content, rather than on its location. The CID is generated by computing a cryptographic hash of the object's data, and combining it with other information, such as the format of the data being addressed, and the algorithmn used to generate the cryptographic hash. [Learn more about CIDs](../concepts/content-addressing.md).

#### InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)

IPFS uses InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) to work with CIDs and content-addressed data. IPFS uses IPLD to structure, serialize, traverse and link content-addressed data. The IPLD linking mechanism allows IPFS to represent complex relationships between objects, such as file directories and other hierarchical structures, in a graph structure.

#### Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files

IPFS uses Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files to store a serialized representation of IPLD data content-addressed data.
