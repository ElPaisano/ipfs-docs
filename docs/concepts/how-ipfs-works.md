# How IPFS works

Data in IPFS is addressed by its contents (content addressing), rather than a location such as a server address (location addressing). Various subsystems in IPFS are responsible for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data.


:::callout
This guide is part 2 of a 2-part introduction to the basic concepts of IPFS. For the first part, what IPFS is and the problems it addresses, see [What is IPFS?](../concepts/what-is-ipfs.md).
:::
In this conceptual guide, you'll learn about the different subsystems that IPFS is comprised of work and how they work.

## How IPFS represents data

IPFS represents data as content-addressed <VueCustomTooltip label="The term for a single unit of data in IPFS." underlined multiline is-medium>blocks</VueCustomTooltip>, and operates on those data blocks using the following subsystems:

- [Content IDentifier (CID)](#content-identifier-cid)
- [InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)](#interplanetary-linked-data-ipld)
- [Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files](#content-addressable-archive-car-files)

### Content IDentifier (CID)

In IPFS, data is chunked into <VueCustomTooltip label="The term for a single unit of data in IPFS." underlined multiline is-medium>blocks</VueCustomTooltip>, which are assigned a unique identifier called a <VueCustomTooltip label="An address used to point to data in IPFS, based on the content itself, as opposed to the location." underlined multiline is-medium>Content IDentifier (CID)</VueCustomTooltip>. In general, the CID is generated for each block by:

1. Computing a cryptographic hash of the block's data.
1. Combining that hash with other information about the block using the following <VueCustomTooltip label="A collection of interoperable, extensible protocols for making data self-describable." underlined multiline is-medium>multiformats</VueCustomTooltip>. 
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established hash function." underlined multiline is-medium>Multihash</VueCustomTooltip> for information on the algorithm used to hash the data.
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating the format of the target data." underlined multiline is-medium>Multicodec</VueCustomTooltip> for information on how to interpret the hashed data after it has been fetched.
   - <VueCustomTooltip label="A protocol for differentiating the encoding of base-encoded (e.g., base32, base36, base64, base58, etc.) binary data appearing in text." underlined multiline is-medium>Multibase</VueCustomTooltip> for information on how the hashed data is encoded.

:::callout
**CIDs will not match the hash of the data**
While a data block's CID is constructed using the cryptographic hash of the data block, a CID contains additional information (described above) that the has does not.
:::

CIDs are unique to the data from which they were computed, which provides IPFS with the following benefits:
- Data can fetched based on it's content, rather than it's location. 
- The CID of the data received can be computed and compared to the CID requested, to verify that the data is what was requested.

The CID protocol has two versions, v0 and v1. Currently, v1 is the preferred version. Each version computes the CID in a slightly different way, Learn more in [the CID deep dive](../concepts/content-addressing.md#cid-versions).

### InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)

IPFS uses <VueCustomTooltip label="A set of specifications in support of decentralized, content-addressable data structures for the web." underlined multiline is-medium>InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)</VueCustomTooltip> to work with CIDs and content-addressed data. IPFS uses IPLD to structure, serialize, traverse and link content-addressed data. The IPLD linking mechanism allows IPFS to represent complex relationships between data, such as file directories and other hierarchical structures, using a <VueCustomTooltip label="Data structured as a graph whose nodes are directionally related to each other and donâ€™t form a directional closed loop." underlined multiline is-medium>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</VueCustomTooltip> called a <VueCustomTooltip label="A special type of DAG where each node has a unique identifier that is a hash of the node's contents." underlined multiline is-medium>Merkle DAG</VueCustomTooltip>. 

IPLD provides IPFS with the following benefits:

- Functionality to structure, serialize, traverse and link content-addressed data
- Interoperable protocols
- Easy upgradeability
- Backwards compatibility
- A single namespace for all hash-based protocols

### Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files

IPFS uses Content Addressable aRchive (CAR) files to store and transfer a serialized archive of IPLD content-addressed data. CAR files are similar to TAR files, in that they that are designed for storing collections of content addressed data.

## How IPFS routes data

While [the subsystems described above](#how-ipfs-represents-data) handle the representation of data, IPFS needs to route the data between <VueCustomTooltip label="Programs that implement the IPFS protocol and participate in the IPFS network. Also referred to as a peer." underlined>nodes</VueCustomTooltip> in the network. In other words, a node cannot simply find data in the network with a CID alone; it requires information about the IP addresses and ports of its <VueCustomTooltip label="Programs that implement the IPFS protocol and participate in the IPFS network. Also referred to as a node." underlined multiline is-left>peers</VueCustomTooltip>  on the network. To handle the routing of data, IPFS uses the following subsystems:

- [Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT)]()
- [Bitswap]()
- [mDNS]()
- [Delegated routing over HTTP]()

### Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

IPFS uses Kademlia, a <VueCustomTooltip label="A decentralized data store that maps data based on key-value pairs." underlined multiline is-left>Distributed Hash Table (DHT)</VueCustomTooltip> designed for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks. Kademlia is used to map what the user is looking for to the peer that is storing the matching content. The Kademlia DHT can be thought as a huge table that stores information on who has what data, and where that data might be located. The Kademlia DHT provides IPFS with:

- A catalog and a navigation system for data on the IPFS network
- Logic for handling undialable peers
- Logic for refreshing the list of peers
- Logic for dropping peers from the DHT if they are inactive or not offline

## How IPFS transfers data

In addition to [routing data](#how-ipfs-routes-data), nodes in the IPFS network must efficiently distribute and deliver the content addressed data, taking into account that there are some nodes in the network who already have a copy of the data, and other nodes who do not have a copy of the data, but want one. To handle the transfer of data, IPFS uses the following subsystems:

- [Bitswap]()
- [IPFS HTTP Gateways]()
- [GraphSync]()
- [Sneakernet]()
