title: IPFS in resource constrained environments
description: Learn about the InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) model and how it forms an important ingredient in IPFS.
---

There are many ongoing projects in the IPFS ecosystem exploring the use of IPFS in resource-constrained environemnts.

Example projects include but are not limited to:
<!-- TODO: add one line descriptions for each -->
- [Aggregore](https://agregore.mauve.moe/), 
- [Durin](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/Durin), a mobile application that allows you to upload and view files on the IPFS network
- [Iroh](https://iroh.computer/), a Rust implementation of IPFS optimized for Cloud, Mobile & Desktop platforms
- [Capyloon](https://capyloon.org/), 
- [ipfs-embed](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed)

<!-- TODO
Create sections to

1) Educate about the resources commonly needed by an IPFS node, e.g. access to TCP/UDP connections, no. of peers, being long-running (to continue publishing to the DHT), be publicly reachable

2) Educate about 
(subsections)
the trade-offs, 
how some responsibilities can be delegated,
the landscape of options (delegated routing over HTTP with link to spec), 
delegated representation and providing pinning services, 
verified retrieval with gateways.

3) Next Steps -> link out to relevant tooling, libraries, and projects working on this.
