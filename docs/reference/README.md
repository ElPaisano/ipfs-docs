# Reference

Looking for user and developer references for IPFS? Find them here.

## HTTP Gateway

The [Gateway API](http/gateway.md) provides implementation-agnostic HTTP interface for retrieving [content-addressed](../concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data from IPFS with regular HTTP clients and libraries. Use it for future-proofing your applications.

## Custom APIs

Implementation and language specific interfaces can be used when [HTTP Gateway API](http/gateway.md) is not enough, or you need additional flexibility.

## [Kubo](../reference/kubo/README.md)

Kubo is the earliest and most widely used implementation of IPFS, written in Go.
