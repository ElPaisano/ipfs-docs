# Configure NAT and Port Forwarding

A common issue for new users running IPFS Kubo, especially on home networks, is that their IPFS node is behind a [NAT (network address translation)](../concepts/glossary.md#nat) layer (such as a residential network router) experience very long wait times or high rate of request failure.
Connection issues that arise as a result of a NAT can be solved with various router configurations, such as port forwarding, each of which is discussed in this guide. 


## Background 

IPFS nodes behind a NAT often have difficulty connecting to the rest of the nodes on the IPFS network. However, there are many benefits to a NAT, because it:

- Allows many machines to share a single public address
- Is essential for the continued functioning of the IPv4 protocol, which would otherwise be unable to serve the needs of the modern networked population with its 32-bit address space.

When you connect to your home WiFi, your computer gets an IPv4 address of something like `10.0.1.15`. This is part of a range of IP addresses reserved for internal use by private networks. When you make an outgoing connection to a public IP address, the router replaces your internal IP with its own public IP address. When data comes back from the other side, the router will translate back to the internal address.

While NATs are generally transparent for outgoing connections, listening for incoming connections requires some configuration. The router listens on a single public IP address, but any number of machines on the internal network could handle the request. To serve requests, your router must be configured to send certain traffic to a specific machine. 

## Configuration Options

The appropriate configuration option for your router depends on your specific setup:

- If your router supports them, [enable IPv6](#enable-ipv6) or [enable UPnP](#enable-upnp) to solve most connection issues
- If IPv6 or UPnP are not available, [enable manual port forwarding](#enable-manual-port-forwarding)

### Enable IPv6

If your router and internet service provider (ISP) support IPv6, enabling it will mitigate some connection issues. Most modern routers have a single option to enable IPv6. We are unable to give detailed information about each router's settings and preferences here. Search your router manufacturer's website for _IPv6_ for information on how to enable it.

### Enable UPnP

If your router supports UPnP, IPFS will attempt to automatically allow inbound traffic to access your local content. Some home routers may need to be configured to explicitly enable UPnP. We are unable to give detailed information about each router's settings and preferences here. Search your router manufacturer's website for _UPnP_.

### Enable DCUtR Holepunching 

Not sure what to put here

Is there a recommended repo or libp2p docs link that we can link to here that explains how to set this up for Kubo? 

https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/DCUtR.md doesn't seem right

https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/hole-punching/#phase-ii-hole-punching? seems to be mostly conceptual

https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-01-20-libp2p-hole-punching/ seems to just explain the theory

Maybe https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/tutorials/hole_punching/index.html and tell the reader that they can follow this tutorial to set up DCUtR Holepunching using Rust? Not specific to Kubo but seems like its the best we've got right now?

### Enable manual port forwarding

If your router does not support UPNP and/or IPv6, or you want better reliability and performance than what DCUtR provides, set up manual port forwarding. Complete the following steps to enable manual port forwarding:

1. [Open a port from the internet to your internal Kubo node](#open-a-port). 
1. [Update the Kubo Configuration](#update-the-kubo-configuration).
1. [Restart your Kubo node](#restart-your-kubo-node). 

First, open a port from the internet to your internal Kubo node.

#### Open a port 

:::tip
Assuming you're not trying to expose your daemon's API to the public internet, opening port `4001`/`tcp` should be sufficient.
:::

Each router has different options and solutions for port forwarding. Most router manufacturers have guides for setting up port forwarding on their devices. In general, the steps are:

1. Log into your router.
1. Locate your routers port forwarding section.
1. Enter the IP address of your IPFS node.
1. Set traffic to go through an outside port. `4001` is recommended if you are unsure.
1. Reboot your IPFS node for the changes to take effect. Make sure to reboot the entire machine, not just the IPFS daemon.

Now that you've opened a port from the internet to your internal Kubo node, update your Kubo configuration to set `Swarm.AppendAnnounce` as a list of addresses that other IPFS nodes will try to contact you at.

#### Update the Kubo Configuration

In this step, you will update your Kubo configuration to set `Swarm.AppendAnnounce` as a list of addresses that other IPFS nodes will try to contact you at. This list lets other nodes on the network that the port forward you created in the previous step know that your node exists, and that these are the addresses at which you can be contacted at. To update your configuration:

1. Open your Kubo configuration file. 

   :::tip
   The default location for the config file is `~/.ipfs/config`. If you have set `$IPFS_PATH`, you can find your config file at `$IPFS_PATH/config`.
   :::
   
1. Find the entry for `AppendAnnounce` in `Addresses` or create an entry for `AppendAnnounce` in `Addresses`:

   ```json
    "Addresses": {
        "Swarm": [
        "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001",
        "/ip6/::/tcp/4001",
        "/ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/4001/quic",
        "/ip6/::/udp/4001/quic"
        ],
        "Announce": [],
        "AppendAnnounce": [],
        "NoAnnounce": [],
        "API": "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001",
        "Gateway": "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080"
    },
    ``` 

1. Update `AppendAnnounce`, where `<public-ip>` is your public IP address and `<port>` is the port number set in the previous step: 

   ```json
   "AppendAnnounce": [
     "/ip4/<public-ip>/tcp/<port>",
     "/ip4/<public-ip>/udp/<port>/quic",
     "/ip4/<public-ip>udp/<port>/quic-v1",
     "/ip4/<public-ip>/udp/<port>/quic-v1/webtransport",
    ],
   ```

   For example, if your public IP address is `1.2.3.4` and `12345` is the port you've choosen, `AppendAnnounce` would look like:

   ```json
   "AppendAnnounce": [
     "/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/12345",
     "/ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/12345/quic",
     "/ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/12345/quic-v1",
     "/ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/12345/quic-v1/webtransport",
    ],
   ```

Now that you've updated your Kubo configuration, restart Kubo so that your node is reachable, and check 

#### Restart your Kubo node

1. Restart your KuboÂ node however you normally would (for example, by running `systemctl --user restart ipfs`). Once Kubo restarts, your node should be reachable. 
1. Check that the outside port is indeed open by...
